        <h2>Where am I from?</h2>
        <p>I currently live in the suburbs but I used to live back in the UK in the lake district in the north of England. I miss the mountains of my home town but Chicagos skyline is nice in its own way. Just below is a video of where I lived for many years of my life.</p>
